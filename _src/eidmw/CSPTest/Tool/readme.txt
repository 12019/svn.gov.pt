This program can be used to test some CSP functionality.
E.g. the signing test uses roughly the same calls as is
done by Word when signing a document.

You should first do a "csptest l" to see which containers
and CSPs are present on your machine and your account.

Note: the CSP has to be signed and 'installed', see
CSP\readme.txt for more info.
Also, one or more certificates have to be registered.
