In order to install the SDK software, the user needs to have root privileges.

Install the Belgian eID middleware SDK by executing the 
script 'install.sh' located in the 'install'-directory as root, eg:
$ sudo ./install.sh

After installing the software, you can start using the libraries.

To uninstall the software, execute 'uninstall.sh' as root, e.g.:
$ sudo ./uninstall.sh

Software dependencies
---------------------
This software depends upon the following libs:
- Qt 4.3.1 or higher
- Xerces-c 2.8
- pcscd


Specific for the Gemplus pinpad reader:
-

You must have Qt installed (version 4.3.1)

Finally the pcscd (smart card daemon) must be up and running.
psscd must also be properly configured in order to be able to 
communicate with your smart card reader of choice.
