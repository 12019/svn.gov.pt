Version info
============

Here's an attempt to put all version info
as much centralized a possible, so you don't
have to modify 25 header/.rc/makefiles in
order to to build a new release (and forget
number 26 so you have to redo it all again.)

For Windows: the versions of the DLLs and EXEs
are put in _Builds/pteidversions.h.
The .rc files for each .vcproj #includes this
header file to get the versions for its DLL/EXE.

On Linux/Mac: the versions of all binaries are
put in _Builds/pteidversions.mak.
All makefiles #include this file to get the
version for their binary.

PS: it's not needed to have versions on test tools,
only on things that will be released.
